# SUMO_Toolbox

## Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing urban mobility analysis through synthetic traffic data generation using the SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) software. We aim to create a detailed and realistic simulation of urban traffic scenarios, incorporating both private and public transportation systems. This project includes datasets, configurations, and scripts necessary to run and analyze traffic simulations in the city of Genoa.
