# SUMO ToolBox
This tool is designed to enhance traffic simulation workflows in [SUMO](https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/) (Simulation of Urban Mobility). It offers a user-friendly interface for managing road closures, rerouting traffic, modifying origin-destination (OD) matrices, and generating synthetic datasets. The tool facilitates the simulation of varied traffic scenarios, making it ideal for traffic flow studies and infrastructure planning.

## Features
  - **OD-Matrices Generation**: create 24-hour OD-matrices based on real daily timelines [1].
  - **Anomaly Creations**: create anomalies in road infrastructure or traffic flow.
  - **Synthetic Dataset Generation**: Generate synthetic datasets using selected dates, directories, and customized stop files.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.11 or higher
- **SUMO**: [Simulation of Urban Mobility](https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/)
