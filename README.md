## 📖 Overview

**SynthCity** is an open-source framework that automatically generates **synthetic urban mobility datasets** featuring **customizable anomalous scenarios**, such as strikes, road closures, and sudden changes in travel demand.

Built on [**Eclipse SUMO**](https://eclipse.dev/sumo/), SynthCity integrates open data formats (OpenStreetMap – OSM, GTFS, OD matrices, shapefiles) into a unified architecture for **simulation, dataset generation, and anomaly injection**.

It provides both a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** and a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**, empowering researchers, practitioners, and urban planners to model realistic *what-if* mobility conditions with minimal effort.

## 🧩 Main Features

- 🧠 **Anomaly Injector Module**  
  Automatically modifies simulation inputs to model:
  - 🚉 *Public transport disruptions* (strikes, stop closures, trip cancellations)  
  - 🚧 *Network disruptions* (road closures, detours, accidents)  
  - 🎫 *Travel demand variations* (event-driven surges or drops)

- 📊 **Synthetic Dataset Generator Module**  
  Converts SUMO outputs into structured CSV + JSON datasets ready for analysis:
  - **Public Transport:** stop-level data with occupancy, delay, and service stats  
  - **Private Vehicles:** trip-level data with duration, route length, and speed  
  - **Network Edges:** edge-level metrics (density, flow, mean speed)

## 🧪 Case Study – Genoa, Italy 🇮🇹

SynthCity was validated using **publicly available open data** from the city of **Genoa**, including:

- 🗺️ **OpenStreetMap network**
- 🚍 **GTFS data from AMT Genova**
- 🧮 **Origin–Destination (OD) matrices** from the City of Genoa

Three representative anomalous scenarios were simulated:

1. 🚇 **Metro Strike** — full suspension of subway service  
2. 🎉 **Special Event** — localized demand surge near the stadium  
3. 🚧 **Road Closure** — disruption of a major arterial road with dynamic rerouting  

The resulting dataset includes **millions of multimodal mobility records** and exhibits **realistic spatio-temporal patterns**, making it suitable for research in:

- 🧠 AI-based mobility modeling  
- 🚦 Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)  
- 🏙️ Urban planning and scenario analysis
